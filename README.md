# pyGPA

A python package collecting an assortment of Geometric Phase Analysis algorithms and tools to analyse regular (moir√©) lattices. Geometric Phase Analysis enables the extraction of a _displacement field_ from a distorted lattice, by comparing to reference waves. As such, it is a spatial variant of lock-in amplification.

From this displacement field, it is possible to extract local properties of the underlying lattice, but also to correct for the distortion, a process known in STM as the Lawler-Fujita algorithm \[[1](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09169)\].
